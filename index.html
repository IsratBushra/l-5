                <h1>Shopping Mall</h1>
                <p>A shopping mall (or simply mall) is a large indoor shopping center, usually anchored by department
                    stores. The term mall originally meant a pedestrian promenade with shops along it, but in the late
                    1960s, it began to be used as a generic term for the large enclosed shopping centers that were
                    becoming increasingly commonplace.[1][2] In the United Kingdom and other countries, shopping malls
                    may be called shopping centres.</p>
